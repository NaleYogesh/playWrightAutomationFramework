create fixture so no need to create object of every page class in other class
playwright assertion like tohavetext tocontent we can not use with method we only use with locators 
in playwright if locator matching with multiple elemnt then we need to specify on which element we need to perform action its not by default perform action on 1st element , and we can direct store in veriable and print using loop no need to describe array 
we can not use tohavetext tocontent direct with element which we locate using getbytext or getByrole
